          <p>I need you all to trust me when I say I'm trying so hard to be composed while writing this. I love this game. I didn't expect to finish the game loving it so much, but the finale was phenomenal. I'm going to be talking about the finale in great detail, and talking about the finale will likely span the entire length of this blog, so this is your first and last spoiler warning if you have not played Yakuza 5 to completion. Every single time I thought the story was getting too out of hand with the plot twist or something contrived came up, it immediately roped me back by bringing up </p>

          <p>Immediately after reaching the credits and closing the game, I spend the next three hours of looking up videos of other people's reaction to the finale to validate my own. This was a huge mistake! I am genuinely so confused at how people thought this game was mid! How did you not enjoy the Saejima's hunter section? How did you not enjoy Shinada as a character? Of course the pacing is a mess, this is the same series that throws you 50+ hours of substories and side stories while the main plot has you on time-sensitive death missions. Come on, lol.</p>
