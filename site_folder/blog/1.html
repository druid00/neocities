          <p>So, I'd really hate to make my first ever blog post on this site about my struggles with depression, but I feel like writing about anything else would be dishonest to how I'm currently doing, lol.</p>
          <p>Recently I finished reading <i>Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression - and the Unexpected Solutions</i> by Johann Hari. I've been trying to put words to why I feel so depressed and to be more proactive in combatting these feelings. The long and short of it is that my mental health is the worst it's ever been, and it's frustrating because I know exactly why: I don't have local friends. I'm living in a dead suburb. I'm still living in my questionably abusive parents' house. I have a college degree and I can't find work.</p>
          <p>The solution that addresses all of these is stupidly simple: I need to find a job, any job, and then use that money to move into a studio apartment in the city. I'll no longer have authority figures surveilling me, I'll be in a location where new people will be within in walking distance, I could maybe even bring people back to my place. I could play some board games with real people! I could maybe even start looking for a relationship without the fear of being outed to my family. I won't have to deal with the intrinsic embarrassment of being poor, unemployable, and still living with my parents. I could finally start my life.</p>
          <p>And this is so frustrating because I cannot find a god damn job for the god damn life of me!!!</p>
          <p>I graduated from college in 2022 with a degree in Computer Science because for my entire life it was engrained into me that programming is the future, if you want to have a career with stability and a good salary then you need to learn how to code. In high school I gave up taking art electives for STEM and business classes because I was constantly told that if I were to be an artist I would be homeless and starving and without work.</p>
          <p>So I went to college as a CS student, and I was miserable. Every single semester I would call my mom crying about how I hated this field and her answer was always the same: she would support whatever decision I made, but I would also need to talk to my dad about it. My dad would be upset with me, and he was also the one paying for my college. She would put my dad on the phone, and he'd say that I already survived through X number of semesters already and that dropping out would leave me with little options in my future. He would be very disappointed. Every single time I called my parents for support, nothing about my situation would change.</p>
          <p>In addition to this, I was hospitalized exactly one month into my second year of college. I had to cancel the semester and my housing and move back home to my parents' house. The semester following I returned to campus, and I was motivated to start looking for internships and co-op experience. This was spring 2020. The pandemic hit during spring break. I had to one again cancel my housing and move back home, once again to my parents' house. All my plans for finding internships were upheaved.</p>
          <p>All this said, I graduated about two years after the pandemic hit without internship or industry experience. The pandemic created so many remote work opportunities in 2020, but at that time I still had two more years of coursework to complete—by the time I graduated in 2022 all those opportunities were being taken away, and companies were forcing their employees back into the office, even ones hired for remote work. Now in 2024, the state of the industry is comical—entry level jobs are requiring 1-2 years of industry experience, internship experience, experience in Python and AWS and Agile and React and miscellaneous APIs (all of which I had never touched in my coursework), multiple stages of coding interviews, multiple stages of personality interviews, take-home tests... all this for a field that I have no interest in, and all this for an industry experiencing catastrophic tsunamis of layoffs while CEOs pocket 7-digit salaries.</p>
          <p>The job market is miserable, and it's making me miserable. I'm miserable because I feel like I've wasted all this energy, all this money, all this time into false promises—being told that I would be homeless if I followed my dreams, being promised stable employment if I went into CS. And I hate myself for not having the guts to take matters into my own hands. I hate that I took all these "programming is the future" anecdotes at face value and decided that this was how I had to live. I could have stood up for myself at any time instead of relying on my parents and said that I was going to be an artist and I was going to put in the work to make it as an artist. But I didn't, and now I'm unemployed—now I'm back where I started, in my parents' house, now with much less time than before.</p>
          <p>Even as I try to build a portfolio of artwork and game projects to break into my dream industries, the writing's on the walls that they're bound to collapse. The purging of talent in the games industry hasn't stopped since the beginning of this year. There's no promise that these jobs will still be there in years to come. There's no entry point that doesn't require exploitation. The only entry level jobs I could possibly be qualified for are those content mill mobile developers that require a new game made every two weeks.</p>
          <p>Even if I wanted to say, screw the industry, I'm going independent: I've had commissions open for two years and in that time I've only had one customer—and that customer was a close friend. I don't have the following to go independent, I don't have the connections to even know where to start.</p>
          <p>So my question is, genuinely, what the hell am I supposed to do?</p>
          <p>I worked retail for about a year after graduation and it left me exhausted and unhappy. I had so little time to work on creative projects and it doesn't pay enough for me to support myself. After quitting that, I found a remote job for an IT call center which overworked us and left me much more unhappy. I can't see myself working in anything but games or art. This is all I have going for me and it's slipping through my fingers.</p>
          <p>And, fuck, I do realize how entitled this all sounds. Millions of people on Earth are working dead end jobs and giving up on their dreams, others are in much worse situations than I am. I wasn't straddled with decades of debt from getting a degree. But it feels like everything is collapsing around me, and I'm so lost on where to go from here.</p>
          <p>I'm not afraid to work for my dreams. I just don't see a dream to work towards.</p>
          <p>I don't know. Maybe I need to grit my teeth and re-study how to program and hope to get a job in software. Maybe the answer is to work retail again for some years and save up to go back to college. Maybe I need to live with my parents and get serious in building a portfolio. I don't know if I'll have the fortitude for that...</p>
          <p>I'm really hesitant to be vulnerable online for many reasons: mainly I don't want to scare people away, make people worry about me, and I want to maintain some semblance of privacy as social media becomes increasingly panoptic. I think I'm pushing myself to post this in hopes of keeping myself accountable: that one day I'll be able to find a job that doesn't drain my spirit. One day I can afford to move out. One day I can live in a city and take walks without asking permission. One day I can look back at this blog and wonder why I even worried that I wouldn't make it there. I really hope that day comes.</p>
