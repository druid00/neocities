          <p>I want a fresh start with my blogs on here, so I'm revamping the webpage and removing my old blogposts in the process. I was treating my old posts as unfiltered diary entries and self-hosted therapy sessions, which is probably a bit too personal than I'm comfortable with being published, in retrospect. lol. Before creating this site I was over-policing what I would say online, so I think I was trying to overcompensate to show that I did have personality. Still trying to find that balance!</p>
          <p>There are other reasons for pulling those posts as well: they were getting very wordy, so writing them was becoming a genuine time commitment publishing them at the rate I was. I don't want to hold myself up to committing to 5k-word posts every time I want to say something here.</p>
          <p>I will give a brief life update: the corporate work portfolio isn't working out, so I'm officially scrapping that project. There are quite literally 0 (zero) job listings for entry level/junior work across every job board website I can find. C'mon. But! Scrapping this project is going to be good for me; I was working way too hard on it and it tanked my mental health, and the more I was reading up on the field the more dread I felt swirling in my stomach.</p>
