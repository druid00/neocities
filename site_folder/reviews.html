            <h2>Civil War (2024)</h2>
            <p><em>Civil War</em> could've been okay if Alex Garland's thesis was that apoliticism in war journalism is stupid, but no, Garland genuinely wants this film to be apolitical and to say as little as possible. So little, that the film never exposits any worldbuilding and the viewer is completely left in the dark about what's going on for the first ~80 minutes—the only reason I had <em>some</em> grasp on the plot was because I saw the alliance faction map posted on Twitter before watching this. That map is the only way the viewer could know what the Western Forces were. It is never explained in the movie.</p>
            <p>There is one decent scene with Jesse Plemons's character but you have to endure over an hour of milquetoast characters and nothingburger plot & the film does nothing to deserve it. Aside from that, the only highlight of this film was the scam website ads sprinkled throughout the playtime because I was watching a shitty camrip the day after it came out in theaters. The recent release of the AI-generated posters is just more confirmation for me that this movie is desperate to reap a legacy as something evocative by using shocking aesthetics while doing none of the work to deserve it, and the end result is spineless dribble. I feel like I was losing my mind seeing all the 4-5 star reviews of this film on Letterboxd! If I see this film discussed in the same sentence as <em>Come and See (1985)</em> one more time, I am going to fucking scream.</p>
            <p>On a better ending note: the <a href="https://letterboxd.com/thejoshl/film/civil-war-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JCPenney Has Fallen</a> review is great and I giggle every time I think of the phrase <em>"JCPenney Has Fallen."</em></p>

            <h2>Happy Together (1997)</h2>
            <p>A story of a tragic gay couple yearning for a spark that is no longer there and experiencing the pain bubble back to the surface in pursuit of it; plus the yearning for something romantic in your platonic relationships that will ultimately never be reciprocated; all while in an environment that is foreign and failing to integrate no matter how hard you try—all this, told through Wong Kar Wai's beautiful lens? Of course I'm eating this shit up man! It's too good. I could love Wong's films based on cinematography alone but he always knocks it out of the park when portraying love in all its ugly nuances.</p>

            <h2>Yakuza 5: Remastered</h2>
            <p>An absolute banger beginning to end. RGG Studios knew they had something special with <em>Yakuza 4</em> but didn't quite meet it at it's full potential—<em>Yakuza 5</em> is their all-out, no-holds-barred rematch at this type of storytelling and it resulted in one of the most fulfilled and poignant entires in the series. Cemented RGG as a masterclass in character writing for me. Also unironcally made me want to get into watching baseball while playing Shinada's part.</p>
