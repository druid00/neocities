        <h1>About Crotovane</h1>
        <p>I am <b>crotovane</b>, you can call me <b>Vane</b>. Any pronouns are fine, I don't mind.</p>
        <p>I am a <b>ditgital artist</b> who is most experienced in illustration and portraiture. Most of my portfolio is fanart of my favorite media and other people's OCs. I draw very slowly and often get artblock (the motivation to draw has been very low given AI discourse and the wave of game industry/artist layoffs), so lately I've been trying to explore new mediums.</p>
        <p>I am currently teaching myself <b>game development</b> in Godot, though I have no projects to show so far. I've made a few games before in Unity, but they are mostly unpolished jam games and I'm just not too proud of their creative vision.</p>
        <p>I enjoy playing games, watching movies, reading manga, classical art, tabletop games and D&D, esoteric media, open source software, nature documentaries, 6th-generation video game consoles, queer readings of aggressively masculine media, and the history of piracy.</p>
        <p>I've never been successful at inserting myself into fandoms or other communities, and I really hate how transactional it feels to talk to others on social media, so I'd really like to make some new friends! I am very shy but I don't bite lol. I would love to meet more game developers, artists, and people to play games with! My DMs are always open.</p>
