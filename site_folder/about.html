        <h1>About Crotovane</h1>
        <p>Hi! I am <b>crotovane</b>, you can call me <b>Vane</b>. I am 24. Any pronouns are fine, I don't mind.</p>
        <p>I'm a digital artist that mostly draws fanart. The motivation to draw has been very low recently given AI discourse and the wave of game industry/artist layoffs, so I've been trying to explore new mediums. I am currently teaching myself game development in Godot, though I have no projects to show so far. I guess I can also add web development to the list after designing this website!</p>
        <p>I've been drawing and doodling for most of my life, but I only started taking art seriously near the end of summer 2020. I had very little friends (none artists), and lockdown left me very lonely, so I turned to posting my art on social media to try to meet new people. While I gained a few followers and met some really nice people (and many extremely talented artists), the act of being on social media as an artist grows more and more and humiliating on Web3 internet. Come 2023, every website has been pillaged by intrusive AI scraping algorithms; come 2024, CEOs are harassing their trans users on their 3-month chess vacations. Engagement on posts is a fraction of what it's been previously. Everything is transactional. Every post seems like engagement farming. Existing on these websites is exhausting.</p>
        <p>I can tell that social media has really distorted my view of my work and interests. If my artwork doesn't get comments or notes, then all previous feelings of accomplishment vanish. I don't feel comfortable tweeting about my interests outside of fandom content because no one would care to engage with it. The grip which engagement has on my online life is ridiculous. So, this website project is my attempt to re-center myself.</p>
        <p>This site came to be on February 29th 2024 (a horrid day IRL. unrelated reasons! lol) as an escape from the noise and as a way to productively spend my time. I've been getting an itch to develop games, and with that, a desire to write journals and devlogs for my projects. Given my fear of posting anything on social media, hosting writeups on my own website seemed like the best path to take. And after browsing some of the pages on Neocities, it seems like a lot of people tend to make pages about literally anything they're interested in—for shrines, to log their anime watchlists—so I'm inspired to make this website a place that is authentically myself and a safe space to post whatever I want. I'm sure that the restlessness over engagement won't go away overnight, but I hope that this website will at least keep me accountable to continue creating and to continue enjoying what I enjoy.</p>
        <p>All of this being said, hello! I promise I'm not this much of a downer all the time lol.</p>
        <p>I enjoy playing games, watching movies, reading manga, classical art, tabletop games and D&D, high fantasy settings, the soundtracks to Skyrim and The Witcher, esoteric media, cute plushies, open source software, modding, 6th- and 7th-generation video game consoles (the PS2 and PS3 remain supreme), Nintendo games, emulation, indie game development, old licensed Spongebob PC games, the Yaukza series, queer readings of aggressively masculine media, the history of pirates, nature documentaries, the ocean, night time city photography, Japanese infrastructure, walkable cities, YouTube deep dives on weird anime, vlogs of people walking through cities in different countries, Jerma985, watching streamers roast David Cage games.</p>
        <p>I still struggle with making and maintaining friends online (and offline), so I'd really like to talk to new people! I'd love to meet more game developers, artists, webmasters, and people to play games with. I am very very shy but I don't bite lol. Anyone can always DM me! (*^‿^*)</p>
